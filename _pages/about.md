  <div class="about-welcome">
    <p>Welcome! I am Professor and Chair of Department of Computer Science at the University of Houston. I received my B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering, and my M.S. & Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering, all from The University of Texas at Austin. After completing my Ph.D. in 1998, I spent two years as a faculty member at Wayne State University. Thereafter, I worked primarily in two different startup companies leading research, development, and expansion efforts as Projects Manager, and President and Chief Operating Officer. In 2005, I joined the University of Houston as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and was promoted to Professor in 2016. Over the years, I have served under diverse leadership positions.  I served as the Director of Undergraduate Studies in the Department of Computer Science (2010–2015) and as Associate Chair (2016–2019) prior to my current position. My involvement at the College and University level includes serving on multiple committees, most notably as Chair of the Undergraduate Committee of the Faculty Senate and member of the Executive Committee of the Faculty Senate.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>I direct research at the Quantitative Imaging Laboratory and my current research focuses on fundamentals of computer vision, machine learning, and statistical methods in image and data analysis with applications in human behavior analysis, person re-identification, video analytics, biometrics, and microscope image analysis. I have co-edited two books, and authored over 150 papers on video analytics, object recognition, sensor fusion, statistical pattern analysis, and biometrics. I currently serves as Associate Editor for Image and Vision Computing, IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering on Health and Medicine, and Pattern Recognition. I received the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics' John C. Butler Teaching Excellence Award in 2011 and the Department of Computer Science Academic Excellence Award in 2010 and 2016.</p>

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
